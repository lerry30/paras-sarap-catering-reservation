-History-About us 
Build Date:2015 
     Paras Sarap Catering Services just like the others, start from scratch. On 2012, Mrs. Glecy Reyes Serrano runs a small business that sells different kinds of Filipino foods and street foods. Upon the conduct of their business, aside from capital, the quality and their customer service become their advantage. An asset that they cherished , this is how they treated their customers and so their market has started to boost. They start to accept bulk orders and for delivery service specifically at occasional times. With the delicious food they offer, that small business started to create a name in the market, being able to compete with others within the same industry in the Municipality of General Tinio. For more than  three years, they offer not just food for every meals consumption but also for celebration that includes a large amount of attendees and so  with the initiative of the customers,  Mrs. Serrano, the owner, decided to expand their business and enter the catering industry. Continuing to progress, Paras Sarap Catering Services today is considered as one of the well-known catering business in General Tinio and adjacent municipalities, and their services extend to Baguio, Pangasinan and Tarlac.
